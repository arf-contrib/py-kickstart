# pykickstart
This is a simple script to set up a new python project. 
It creates a yml file for github actions to run isort and Black on pull requests, creates empty requirements.txt, LICENSE and README.md files, and initializes git.

The initial setup of this repository was done with this script, so should also be an example of the results of its use.
